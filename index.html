	Hello, 
	<br>
	My name is Alex Schmertmann. I am currently a senior at the University of Iowa 
	pursuing a B.B.A. in Business Analytics and Information Systems focused on the
	Information Systems track. I was born and raised in Bettendorf, Iowa and have always 
	been a fan of the Hawkeyes. I enjoy working with technology and data, because they 
	are rapidly growing fields that are very useful for any type of business to develop 
	insights and create efficiencies. I am very eager to learn more about development 
	this semester in my classes of Application Development and Software Design. Outside 
	of school I enjoy traveling, rollerblading, playing cards, and hanging out with friends.
